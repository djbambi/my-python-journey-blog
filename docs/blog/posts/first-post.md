# Starting the PyBites PDM – from “can code” to “can build”

__I’ve started the PyBites Professional Developer Mindset (PDM) program, and it already feels like the *right* kind of discomfort.__

Not the *“I don’t understand Python at all”* kind of discomfort —  
but the subtler, more interesting one:

*realising there are gaps between writing Python that works and writing Python that holds up in production.*

## Why I signed up

I can write Python. I’ve done it professionally.

I’ve built pipelines, Lambdas, Glue jobs, and scripts that solve real problems. I can usually get things working, debug issues when they arise, and ship solutions that deliver value.

But I kept noticing something.

- I could **get things working**
- I could **debug issues**
- I could **ship solutions**

Yet when I read *really good* Python — the kind that’s calm, intentional, and obvious — I felt a gap.

Not a knowledge gap exactly.  
More a **mindset gap**.

That’s what drew me to PDM.

## What “developer mindset” actually means (so far)

Very early on, one thing became clear: this isn’t about learning new syntax.

It’s about learning to consistently ask better questions:

- *What is the responsibility of this piece of code?*
- *What assumptions am I making here?*
- *Could someone else understand this without me explaining it?*
- *Would I be happy maintaining this in six months?*

None of those questions are Python-specific — but they show up **in** Python, every day.

---

## The first small but important shift

One change I’ve already made as a direct result of starting PDM is this:

I’m writing **notes as if I’m teaching**.

Not documentation-after-the-fact, but *thinking-through-the-problem-on-paper*:

- Why did this fail?
- What did I misunderstand?
- What’s the underlying mechanism?
- What’s the rule of thumb I want to remember?

This blog exists largely for that reason.

Writing forces me to be precise.  
Precision exposes gaps.  
Gaps tell me what to work on next.

## What I’m hoping to get out of PDM

I’m not chasing “clever” code.

I want to get better at:

- Writing **simple code that stays simple**
- Making intent obvious
- Reducing cognitive load
- Being deliberate about structure, not accidental
- Developing habits that scale beyond a single script

In short: **becoming someone who builds systems, not just solutions**.

## Early takeaway

If I had to summarise the early feeling in one sentence:

> *This isn’t about learning more Python — it’s about learning how to think while writing Python.*

That feels like time well spent.

I’ll keep using this blog to capture what I’m learning, where I’m getting stuck, and what’s starting to click.
